# eCommerce Application 🛍️🌐

Our e-commerce application is a platform that reproduces the real shopping experience in the digital environment.  It is an online shopping portal that provides a seamless user experience from product discovery to checkout, increasing user engagement and purchase confidence. 🏪

To make the shopping process more streamlined and convenient, our application has implemented functionality that provides the ability to register a user and log in 📝, search for products 🔍, classify and sort them.
Users can view a wide range of products and a detailed description of each product, add the products they like to the shopping cart 🛒 and proceed to checkout 💳.

In order for the application to look great on various devices with a minimum resolution of 390 pixels, we made it responsive 📲. This feature ensures the user experience of the application, no matter what device the user prefers.

Key pages in the application include:

- Login and Registration pages 🖥️
- Main page 🏠
- Catalog Product page 📋
- Detailed Product page 🔎
- User Profile page 👤
- Basket page 🛒
- About Us page 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️
